## Lectures

### Module 1 — Traditional software systems vs ML systems

> In traditional software, behavior is specified; in ML systems, behavior is learned — and everything hard about ML systems follows from that.

- [Lecture 0 — Course Overview](docs/lectures/Lecture0.md): How ML systems differ from traditional software · evolution of AI paradigms · the data/algorithms/infrastructure triad · The Bitter Lesson
- [Lecture 1 — Machine Learning Lifecycle](docs/lectures/Lecture1.md): The ML lifecycle vs the traditional build–test–release loop · engineering practices (versioning, tracking, monitoring) · Waymo case study · core challenges

### Module 2 — GPU Fundamentals & Hardware-Software Stack
- [Lecture 2 — Why Accelerators Exist](docs/lectures/Lecture2.md): The CPU baseline · the memory wall · what the matmul workload demands · design the hardware yourself
- [Lecture 3_4 — The Memory Hierarchy and the Roofline](docs/lectures/Lecture3_4.md): The matmul ladder from naive Python to GPU · SIMD, tiling, threads · arithmetic intensity · the roofline model · two GPU timing traps
- [Lecture 5_6 — GPU Job Submission](docs/lectures/Lecture5_6.md): Who moves the bytes during a disk read · PCIe, posted vs non-posted · MMIO and BARs · DMA · ring, doorbell and fence · why an unsynchronized kernel launch measures nothing
- [Lecture 7 — Inside the GPU: Execution & Latency Hiding](docs/lectures/Lecture7.md): How a GPU keeps thousands of ALUs busy · SMs, warps and SIMT · a CUDA core is not a core · latency hiding by oversubscription · why the register file is bigger than L1 · divergence and occupancy
- [Lecture 8 — Inside the GPU: Memory & the Roofline](docs/lectures/Lecture8.md): What limits GPU performance · the memory hierarchy · shared memory is not a cache · coalescing and the working-set cliff · building both roofline axes from `rocminfo` · why LLM decode is memory-bound and training compute-bound on the same GPU
- [Lecture 9_10 — Inference Optimization](docs/lectures/Lecture9_10.md): Server + model + hardware + workload · online vs batch vs embedding workloads · TTFT, TPOT, MFU and MBU mapped onto them · why prefill is compute-bound and decode memory-bound · GPU-only vs CPU offloading vs CPU-only · predicting token rate on paper · a purchase decision worked end to end
- [Lecture 11_12 — Model Artifacts](docs/lectures/Lecture11_12.md): What is inside a `.pt` · pickle as a program, not a document · safetensors and safety by removing the mechanism · strides, contiguity and who pays for packing · GGUF for runtimes with no Python · ONNX and the model as a graph · what a format cannot do for you
<!-- - [Lecture 13_14 — Decoding Strategies](docs/lectures/Lecture13_14.md): Transformer revision ending at the LM head · the autoregressive loop and why `select()` is outside the model · greedy search and the repetition trap · beam search and why likelihood is the wrong objective for open-ended text · temperature as exponential ratio reshaping · the long-tail failure of pure sampling · top-k vs nucleus (top-p) · choosing a strategy per task -->

### Labs

- [Lab 5/6 — GPU Job Submission](docs/labs/Lab5_6.md) ([notebook](docs/labs/Lab5_6_gpu_job_submission.ipynb)): Measure the submission protocol on your own GPU or a free Colab T4 · submission vs execution (and the throughput number that beats the hardware) · per-launch and per-fence cost · pinned memory · stream overlap · CUDA Graphs. Marked 40 automatic + 60 rubric; see [`code/gpu_submission/grade_submissions.py`](code/gpu_submission/grade_submissions.py)
- [Lab 2 — The Concurrency Budget](docs/labs/Lab2.md) ([notebook](docs/labs/Lab2_concurrency_budget.ipynb)): Pairs with Lecture 7 and shares no experiment with it · memory latency by pointer chase · achieved bandwidth from a grid-stride copy · Little's Law to predict the bytes a GPU must keep in flight · the block-scheduling quantum read off a wave-quantisation staircase · the tail effect. Needs CUDA or ROCm (Triton has no Metal backend). Marked 35 automatic + 65 rubric; see [`code/gpu_internals/grade_lab2.py`](code/gpu_internals/grade_lab2.py)
- [Lab 11/12 — Three Formats, One Model](docs/labs/Lab11_12.md) ([notebook](docs/labs/Lab11_12_model_artifacts.ipynb)): Pairs with Lecture 11/12 · save one model as `.pt`, `.safetensors` and `.gguf` and measure what each flattening costs · file size, cold vs warm load, RSS and `rchar` · the `.contiguous()` cost curve · the pickle trust boundary · read a real GGUF. CPU-only, no GPU needed. Marked 40 automatic + 60 rubric; see [`code/artifacts/grade_lab11_12.py`](code/artifacts/grade_lab11_12.py)
- [Lab 13/14 — Decoding Strategies, Measured](docs/labs/Lab13_14.md) ([notebook](docs/labs/Lab13_14_decoding_strategies.ipynb)): Pairs with Lecture 13/14 · measure the next-token distribution and what each strategy does to it · greedy determinism and argmax · temperature's `P(top)` and sample diversity · top-k vs top-p nucleus size · beam vs greedy log-prob (and why beam can lose). CPU-only (`gpt2`), no GPU needed. Marked 40 automatic + 60 rubric; see [`code/decoding/grade_lab13_14.py`](code/decoding/grade_lab13_14.py)



## Notebooks

- [GGUF, the long way around](docs/notebooks/gguf_the_long_way_around.ipynb) — *Module 4.* From a two-parameter PyTorch model to the byte layout of a real model file: `state_dict` → pickle (and its exploit) → safetensors → checkpoints → GGML → GGUF. Implements safetensors and GGUF readers/writers from their specs, then parses a real quantised model and derives its bits-per-weight. After Vicki Boykis, [*GGUF, the long way around*](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/02/28/gguf-the-long-way-around/).

## Trust & Transparency notes

- **Source & Attribution**: This repository contains course materials, templates, and syllabus structure authored by the course instructor, [Ankush Chander](https://github.com/Ankush-Chander), for Dhirubhai Ambani University. Lab submissions and custom profiling implementations are authored by me.
- **Motive**: Created as a coursework log and laboratory playground for learning ML Systems Engineering principles (focusing on GPU execution protocols and bottleneck diagnostics).
- **Modifications**: Coded profiling loops for measuring GPU job submission costs, PCIe page-locked memory speeds, and asynchronous stream execution, saving metrics in custom JSON outputs.
- **Limitations**:
  - The repository's primary focus is academic, meaning components are structured around course lab prompts rather than production-grade libraries.
  - Most labs authored by me were run on my MacBook M4 Air or within a GitHub Codespace (where Linux is required); therefore, the performance metrics should not be taken as absolute benchmarks.
- **Tooling & AI Usage**: No AI was used to write the code. Gemini assistance was utilized solely to research course concepts and help structure the text explanations in the markdown reports.
